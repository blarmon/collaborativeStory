- use react to create sidebars and the like (any reuseable component)
- figure out databases lol, get the stories in em :O
- 'lock' a story upon submission so users can digest new submissions before submitting (10 seconds?)
- create users with ratings on their submissions.  users who submit better content as judged by other users get access to better stories (also jusdged by users?)

- let users sort stories by rating, and other factors.
- search bar
- favorites
- story categories
- get rid of inactive stories?
- allow users to 'branch' stories to create a new instance of the same story if they disagree about the direction of the sotry
